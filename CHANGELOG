########## Version 0.1.1 (June 2011) ###################

The following changes were made in Version 0.1.1 of R package HiDimDA:

1) A bug was corrected in the print method for class SigFqInv: in
   version 0.1.0 the print.SigFqInv method assumed incorrectly that 
   the 'x' argument was an object describing a covariance and not 
   a precision matrix. 

2) The names of functions ForbSigap and ForbSigap1 (approximation of
   covariance matrices by minimization of error Frobenius norms) were
   changed to FrobSigAp and FrobSigAp1, and additional arguments were introduced,
   given the user more control of optimization procedure. 
   Alias to the previous names were created in order to maintain backward compability.
   A bug was corrected in the function FrobSigAp1: this version of the approximation 
   function that takes as input the matrix square root of the covariance to be 
   approximated (instead of the covariance itself, as function FrobSigAp does), 
   was not working properly in version 0.1.0.

3) The method RFlda for data frames and the methods LeftMult and
   RightMult for classes SigFq and SigFqInv (specialized matrix products
   for objects of classes SigFq and SigFqInv), that previously were internal
   to the package, are exported in version 0.1.1.

4) The help files were improved and updated.
