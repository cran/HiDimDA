########## Version 0.2-4 (October 2015) ###################

The default package "stats" and several functions from the default package "graphics" were imported 
into the HiDimDa namespace, to ensure that they did not become undefined globals. 

########## Version 0.2-3 (March 2015) ###################

Several S3method directives were added to the NAMESPACE file
in order to register the respective S3 methods.

########## Version 0.2-2 (October 2014) ###################

The following changes were made in Version 0.2-2 of R package MAINT.Data:

1) In the DESCRIPTION file the Depends directive for imported packages was repalced by an Imports directive

2) A few lines of the the c++ source code were changed in order to enforce compatibility
   with the compilers used by the flavours r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang,
   r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-gcc and r-devel-osx-x86_64-clang. 

########## Version 0.2-1 (July 2012) ###################

A makevar.win file was added to the src directory in order to proper
link required Lapack routines under Windows

########## Version 0.2-0 (June 2012) ###################


The following major changes were made in Version 0.2-0 of R package HiDimDA:

1) In adition to the original RFlda (linear discriminant analysis based
   on a factor-model estimator of the correlation matrix), three new 
   classifiers were included in the package:
   (i) Dlda which peforms Diagonal linear discriminant analysis.
   (ii) Slda which performs Shrunken linear discriminant analysis 
    using the shrunken covariance estimators of Ledoit-Wolf/Fisher-Sun.
   (iii) Mlda which performs Maximum uncertainty linear discriminant 
    analysis as proposed by Thomaz, Kitani and Gillies.

2)  RFlda and the three new (Dlda, Slda and Mlda) discrimination routines,
    now return by default canonical discriminant functions, while 
    direct-classification functions (the main output of RFlda in version 0.1-1
    are returned only the the argument ldafun is set to "classification"

3)  Two S3 classes named canldaRes and clldaRes (both a predict method) were created 
    in order to store in a uniform format the results of a canonical (canldaRes)
    or classification (canldaRes) analysis for the four classifiers now available.
    Four extensions of these classes named RFcanlda, Scanlda, RFcllda and Scllda
    were also created in order to add the estimated covariance and precision (in
    appropriate objects using compact representations) matrices to the results 
    returned by RFlda and Slda.	  

4)  The examples and documentation were updated.



########## Version 0.1-1 (June 2011) ###################

The following changes were made in Version 0.1-0 of R package HiDimDA:

1) A bug was corrected in the print method for class SigFqInv: in
   version 0.1.0 the print.SigFqInv method assumed incorrectly that 
   the 'x' argument was an object describing a covariance and not 
   a precision matrix. 

2) The names of functions ForbSigap and ForbSigap1 (approximation of
   covariance matrices by minimization of error Frobenius norms) were
   changed to FrobSigAp and FrobSigAp1, and additional arguments were introduced,
   given the user more control of optimization procedure. 
   Alias to the previous names were created in order to maintain backward compability.
   A bug was corrected in the function FrobSigAp1: this version of the approximation 
   function that takes as input the matrix square root of the covariance to be 
   approximated (instead of the covariance itself, as function FrobSigAp does), 
   was not working properly in version 0.1.0.

3) The method RFlda for data frames and the methods LeftMult and
   RightMult for classes SigFq and SigFqInv (specialized matrix products
   for objects of classes SigFq and SigFqInv), that previously were internal
   to the package, are exported in version 0.1.1.

4) The help files were improved and updated.
